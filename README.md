# SabnzbdLunaseaNotify
Python script to send a notification for events within Sabnzbd to the custom notification API for Lunasea

# Usage: 

First, install requests

`pip install requests`

Open the script and change line 74. Add your device token, in quotes, after `device_token = `

`device_token = "abcdefghijklm" `

Save the python file wherever Sabnzbd looks for scripts. You may have to look around in Sabnzbd settings under "Folders" to find the Scripts folder. Place this python file within that directory. You will be able to select the notification script by turning on the custom notification script option in the Sabnzbd settings.

Enjoy!
